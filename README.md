# Guess-Random-Number

This project is a simple number guessing game implemented using Python. The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100 using the random.randint() function. The player is asked to guess the number, and after each guess, the program provides feedback. If the guess is too high, the player is prompted to guess a smaller number. If the guess is too low, they are prompted to guess a larger number. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number, at which point the game congratulates the player and ends.
